okay what I need to do now is
* protect from XXS (lab 3)
    * it is in the html
    * how do I do this if it is in flask??
* protect against sql injection (lab 4)
    * did that
* write my sql statements in fragments
* figure out how to print the generated password to the page (maybe binary converter lab from cs 121??)
* if username is empty, prompt them to make one, or maybe automatically generate one
